## Welcome to Project Populate Json Assets for Stardew Valley!

![PPJA Header](https://i.imgur.com/HHpqNMs.png)

This is the main hub for Project Populate Json Assets was created by a large team lead by Paradigmnomad. A full list of contributors is included on the [wiki page](https://github.com/paradigmnomad/PPJA/wiki/Artist-Credits). PPJA is now managed by just myself as I have retired from SDV.

Further information can be found in the [Outdated PPJA Wiki](https://github.com/paradigmnomad/PPJA/wiki).

## Installation and Dependencies

This mod requires the SMAPI modding framework; if you have not installed SMAPI before, see [here](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Modding:Player_Guide/Getting_Started#Getting_started) for instructions. This mod also requires [Dynamic Game Assets](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/9365), a mod framework that allows custom items to be added to the game without modifying the XNB files; be sure to [download Dynamic Game Assets from Nexus](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/9365) and install it before using this mod. Some Dynamic Game Asset packs may require the use of [Producer Framework Mod](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/4970); a framework that allows custom machines.

Some packs may also use [Content Patcher](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/1915) or [Mail Framework Mod](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/1536) to pair with their Dynamic Game Asset packs. These frameworks can help add more content to pre-existing Dynamic Game Asset content packs.

If all dependency mods are installed, then download the file for the content pack you have chosen, extract it, and move it to the `Mods` folder in your games file to install it. To uninstall the content pack, remove any items from the pack in game and delete from your `Mods` folder. Missing items can cause your game to crash so double check any chests beforehand. Recipes & items in shops do not have to be removed.

## Migrating from JA to DGA

PPJA's (former) JA components are fully ready, day-one for use with DGA. Below is a, short, list of major changes.

* Multi Yield Crop components have been removed and merged into DGA;
* Content Patcher Animations components have been removed and merged into DGA;
* Basic machines have been migrated from Producer Framework Mod to DGA - a PFM component is still required from more advanced things. Check the PFM page for updates on DGA compatibility;
* HCE support for Cannabis Kit will come in the future;
* Some recipes that previously were locked behind visiting the Island have now been moved to Island shops;
* [CP] Legacy Sprites has been broken up into legacy sprite configs for their relevant DGA packs - consider [CP] Legacy Sprites obselete;

I came out of retriement, briefly, to update PPJA to DGA. It used the latest Git version which means if there was a bug on Git, it probably is present in the DGA version. Now I go back into retirement until dependencies update if I need to change formatting.

You can still continue to use the Json Assets version of this mod if you want to wait until all of the dependencies are updated. Consider the JA version of PPJA to be obselete and no longer maintained.
